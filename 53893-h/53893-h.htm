<p class='c003'>“In its power to assume always
that form of energy which happens
to be the most useful lies the great
importance of electricity.” This importance
has been brought to the notice
of the public by means of the many
recent exhibitions. Public interest has
been roused and there is everywhere a
desire for information and a guide
through this far reaching field for discovery
and invention. And, although
there are many works treating on electricity
and electric light, people specially
want a short and concise though thorough
description of the various schemes
by which electric light is produced. In
this thesis the object is to give a brief
treatise on one of the many schemes
of producing light by electric currents
viz—The Thomson-Houston System.</p>

<p class='c004'>In pursuing the subject of electricity,
the first thing noticed is the analogy
and difference between the dynamo
and its older and more powerful rival
the steam engine. The resemblances are,
First as in the development of the steam
engine, but few of the improvements and
inventions in electrical machines were
made by mathematical leaders. Watt
ran across the idea of the seperate
condenser while repairing the Newcomen
model and applied the
expansion of steam to the steam
engine by a mechanical accident
rather than by his own ingenuity,
and so we find the first designers
of the dynamo were mechanics rather
than philosophers. Secondly the
tendency to disregard old methods
and instruments because of new
discoveries and inventions has, as in
the steam engine, hindered the
advancement in electrical science.
As an example it has become customary
to regard frictional and statical
electric machines, for practical
purposes, as obsolete, but recent discoveries
seem to hint that they may
yet be utilized. Lately Prof. Dodge has
shown that dust and vapor whirling
in the air may be settled by a
discharge of electricity consisting of
a continuous series of electric sparks.
This has been utilized to clear the atmosphere
in lead smelting works
from the fumes of volatized lead
and with its application comes the
invention of Wimhurst which produces
with a minimum of mechanical
labor a continuous series of electric
sparks and works admirably.</p>

<p class='c004'>The differences between the engine’s
and dynamo’s developement are:
<i>First</i> the marvelously rapid developement
of the dynamo as compared with
that of the steam engine. Since 1867
when the term “dynamo electric machinery”
even to scientific men had
but little signification, the dynamo
has been brought to a very high
degree of perfection. <i>Secondly</i>, the
development of the dynamo has
reached a much higher degree of
perfection than that of the steam
engine. Among the best steam engines
twenty per cent effeciency is
considered as very good while a good
dynamo gives out in the form of
electricity, ninety per cent of the
mechanical energy put in it. But
the class of people who improved and
made the steam engine what it is
were as well educated in one sense
as were the men who brought out
the dynamo. While it is true that in
Watt’s time the knowledge concerning
steam was very meagre, yet the
practical men who <i>made</i> the dynamo,
did it by themselves as nearly
all the teachers of electricity knew
nothing except what may be called
electrical tricks. As has been said<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c005'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
“The teachers and writers of textbooks,
practically did not know that there
was anything in common between
the electricity from a rubbed glass machine
and voltaic electricity, or to be
brief, that there was a science of electricity
as distinguished from mere
natural history.” In fact as late as
1870 there were really no textbooks
on electricity. Even now electrical
knowledge is so meagre as to warrant
the same writer’s expression,
“We can not imagine a mechanical
engineer mistaking a few inches
for a few miles or a grocer compounding
an ounce of sugar with a carload,
but this gives too truthful an
idea of the vagueness that still exists.”</p>

<p class='c004'>In the distant future, electricity will
be used for electric lighting only as
subordinate to other uses to which
it may be applied such as heating
houses, taking place of stoves for
cooking, being used as a substitute
for the steam engine. In fact the
motor is rapidly becoming of as much
practical use as the electric light.
The principle of the motor is just
this; a certain amount of mechanical
energy say thirty four horsepower
per minute into the form of
electric currents, which by the way
gives enough current to run 45,
2000 candle power lamps, send the
current and distance through suitable
conductors and attach them
to similar dynamo or dynamos but
in such a manner that the current
in the second set of dynamos flows
in the reverse direction to that
of the first; when, the armature of
the second dynamo or dynamos will
revolve and at the pulley or pulleys
of the dynamos, aside from friction,
will be given out 95% of the thirty-four
horsepower, the loss being
due to the resistance of the conductors.
Now in practice a motor
is placed on the arc light circuit
the same as a lamp, for energy
less than twelve horsepower. It
does not affect the lights and is a
clean, neat way of obtaining energy.</p>

<p class='c004'>But however true the foregoing
may be, the greatest present use
of electricity is to start and maintain
light. There are several so-called
systems, embracing dynamos,
lamps, regulators, etc, from
which I select the Thomson-Houston
as the one for the purpose of
describing for several reasons, <i>first</i>,
it is at least as good as the average
system of which there is a mushroom
growth; <i>second</i>, valuble information
was kindly offered by the parent
Company; <i>third</i>, a good plant is
near to which free acess was given,
and <i>fourth</i>, we have at the Mechanical
Hall of this University, a dynamo,
loaned by the parent Company,
which affords information without
any inconvenience. As each part
of the system comes up to be described
a little of its history will be given.
As the first part of a system
necessary to be produced is the current
generator we will first describe</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>The Thomson-Houston Dynamo.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In considering the current generator
the first thing to be decided
upon is the definition of the term
dynamo. The following is thought
to be a correct definition,—A dynamo
or dynamo electric machine is
a machine which is used to convert
energy in the form of mechanical
motion into energy of electric
currents, or <i>vica-versa</i>. Those used
to generate currents of electricity
are called dynamos, those used to
generate mechanical motion are
known as motors.</p>

<p class='c004'>In attempting to make clear
the theory of the dynamo, we will
recall some simple experiments.
In Fig. 1, send a current around B from
right to left. Now A being free to move
vertically either up or down, connect
its binding posts to a <i>galvanometer</i>
(that is, an instrument used to tell the
direction of a current and also used to
test the <i>relative</i> strength of two or more
currents) and move A up suddenly
when a current will be generated
in A whose direction will be the
same as that of the current in B. Now
this current is not created energy,
because in lifting<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c005'><sup>[2]</sup></a> the coil A, work
is expending against the attraction
between the coils, as between two
currents flowing in the same direction
there is an attraction. If we pursue
this experiment in its various forms
we will find the following statement
known as Lentz law is true, viz: “If
the relative positions of two conductors
A and B be changed of which B
is traversed by a current, a current
is induced in A in such a direction
that by its electro dynamic action on
the current in B it would have imparted
to the conductor a motion
of the contrary kind to that by which
the inducing action was produced.”</p>

<p class='c004'>The theory of this law is that
around every wire carrying a current
there is a magnetic whirl
(Fig. 3). Now if the conducting wire
be passed through a hole in a
horizontal plate of glass and iron
filings be sifted upon the latter
they will arrange themselves,
as shown in Fig. 2., along lines, radial
in this case, known as lines
of force, which arranging is due
to the magnetic attraction of the
current in the wire upon the
iron filings. Now in B. Fig. 1, every
portion of the wire has just such
a whirl and just such lines of
force, or magnetic field, and when
A is moved each part of the wire of
A cuts one or more lines of force of
the many magnetic fields making
up the magnetic field of the
entire coil B. Now when the wire
of coil A cuts magnetic field of B a
current is generated in A acording
to the following statement known
as Faraday’s Law; “When a conductor
in a field of force moves in any way
so as to cut the lines of force there
is an electromotive force produced
in the conductor in such a direction
that supposing a figure swimming
in the conductor to turn to look
along the positive direction of the
lines of force (in Fig. 1, toward axis of B),
and the conductor be moved to his
right, he will be swimming with the
current so induced.” Hence in Fig. 1, the
current generated in it will be from
left to right.</p>

<p class='c004'>Practically Faraday’s principle
means just this: by moving a wire
across a space where there are magnetic
lines, the motion of the wire as
it cuts the magnetic lines sets up
around the cutting wire a magnetic
whirl or in other words sets
up a current in that wire.</p>

<p class='c004'>The foregoing laws are the
“principles of the dynamo,” yet after
their deduction, the progress of the
evolution of the dynamo was slow
and attended by many dificulties.
Between 1860 and 1870 however, a working
knowledge of these laws became
the property of thousands of mechanics,
and by comparing the number
of inventions before and after
that date (1860) the present generous
growth of systems, dynamos and
lamps, prove that inventions were
almost in proportion to the number
of people who had any electrical
knowledge. In 1866 Wilde produced
a toy magneto-electric machine
for giving shocks, in which he used
excited electromagnets. In the same
years Varley and others produced a
machine which excited its own
field magnets the type of all machines
used in practice. With this
principle of Varley’s and Pacinnotti’s
ring, Gramme produced in 1871 his
since famous continuous current
generator, one of which the second
dynamo electric machine ever brought
to this country can now be seen at
the engine house at Purdue University.
In 1877 Silas Brush brought out his
famous dynamo and it may be interesting
to know that he designed
and had one made without experimenting
in the least. In the following
year a patent was issued to
Messrs. Elihu Thomson and Edwin J.
Houston, Professors of electricity in Philadelphia
on the present though much
improved <i>Thomson Houston Dynamo.</i></p>

<p class='c004'>To go back to Lentz and Faraday’s
laws and carefully consider them we
can but assent to S. P. Thompson’s “fifteen
propositions on the dynamo” which
are:—1. A part of the energy of an electric
current exists in the form of a magnetic
whirl surrounding the wire.</p>

<p class='c004'>2. Currents may be generated in a
wire by setting up these whirls.</p>

<p class='c004'>3. We can set up these whirls by
increasing or decreasing the relative
distance between magnets and wires.</p>

<p class='c004'>4. To set up and maintain these
whirls consumes power.</p>

<p class='c004'>5. To induce currents in a conductor
there must be motion between
them so as to alter the number of
lines of force (Fig. 4 to 7).</p>

<p class='c004'>6. Increase in the number of
lines of force in the circuit produces
a current of the opposite sense to
decrease (Fig. 7).</p>

<p class='c004'>7. Approach induces electromotive force
in the opposite direction
to that induced by retreat.</p>

<p class='c004'>8. The stronger the magnetic field
the stronger the current.</p>

<p class='c004'>9. The more rapid the motion the stronger
the current.</p>

<p class='c004'>10. The greater the length of the conductor
which cuts lines of force the stronger
the current.</p>

<p class='c004'>11. The shorter the conductor not so
employed the stronger the current.</p>

<p class='c004'>12. Approach being a finite process
the approaching and receeding must
give alternating directions to the
current.</p>

<p class='c004'>13. By the use of a commutator all
the currents can be turned in the same
direction.</p>

<p class='c004'>14. In a steady circuit it makes no
difference what kind of magnets are
used to procure the requisite magnetic
field whether permanent
or electromagnets.</p>

<p class='c004'>15. Hence the current of the generator
may be used to excite the magnetism
of field magnets.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the Thomson-Houston dynamo
comes under that class of dynamos
in which there is a rotation of
coils in a uniform field of force,
such rotation (Fig. 6.) being affected
round an axis in the plane of the
coil. Of course this dynamo is made
like all others of its class to have <i>first</i>,
as powerful field-magnets as possible,
<i>second</i>, the armature or rotating coil
has as great a lenght of wire in it
as possible the wire being thick to
offer little resistance and <i>third</i>,
built to stand high rotative speed.</p>

<p class='c004'>The simple theoretical dynamo
is shown at Fig. 8, consisting of a
single rectangular loop of wire
rotating in the magnetic field formed
by large magnets, and in order
to take the current so generated from
the loop so as to give a continuous
current, we use a two part commutator
(Fig. 9) consisting of a metal
tube split in two and mounted on
wood, each half connected to one end
of the loop. The current is taken off by
brushes which lead to the main circuit.
But manifestly this dynamo
would give no appreciable current
becase it has a very small length
of wire on the armature, so a great
number of loops were used which
at present constitute the so-called
<i>drum armature</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>We may rotate the loops of wire
in Fig. 8, on one of its sides as an axis
or even push it farther from the
center of revolution than that. To do
this, wrap the wire around a ring and
connect both ends to a two part commutator
(Fig. 10). If instead of the ring in
Fig. 10, being solid it be a number of
coils of wire and if instead of there
being one coil around the ring there
be thirty we will have Pacinnotti’s
ring before spoken of. If we used
four to ten coils or “bobbins” of large
size which is shown diagramatically
at Fig. 11, we would have the Brush dynamo.</p>

<p class='c004'>So with exceptions we may say
that there are practically two types
of dynamos as regards armatures, the
<i>ring</i> type as Brush, Pacinnotti’s Gramme,
and the <i>drum</i> armature (page 20).</p>

<p class='c004'>The Thomson-Houston dynamo
is like the rest of that dynamo,
unique. To quote S. P. Thompson; “The
Thomson-Houston spherical armature
is unique among armatures, its
cup shaped field magnets are unique
among field magnets, its three part
commutator is unique commutators.”</p>

<p class='c004'>An armature of a dynamo is
the rotating coil or coils which generates
currents of electricity by moving
in a magnetic field of force. It is
the most important part of a dynamo
as it is literally the current generator. So we
first consider the Thomson-Houston</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>Armature</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is spheroidal in shape as is noted
for the fact of its very seldom <i>burning
out</i>, i. e., the electricity heating the
wires of the armature to such an
extent as to destroy the insulation or
fuse the wires, either rendering the armature
useless. It is made by keying
two dish-shaped iron disks <i>SS</i> Fig. 12, to the
shaft x and putting ribs <i>dd</i> about
ten in number in the twenty-five
light machine, and over the whole
putting varnished paper. Then at stated
intervals, pegs JJJ are driven into
suitable holes in the disks and ribs
to help in winding wire on the shell.
Next three insulated wires of equal length
are joined together at <i>h</i> Fig. 13, and the three
wires are then wound over the shell
in the following peculiar manner:
one half of No. 1 is wound so as to form
a zone of a sphere of which the shaft is in the
same plane as the center circumference
of the zone. The armature is then turned
on the shaft as an axis 120° and one half
of No. 2 is wound in the same manner
as the first half of No. 1. The armature
is moved 120° more and all of No. 3 is
wound. The armature is then turned
back, 120° on the shaft as an axis and
the remainder of No. 2 is wound. Lastly
the armature is turned back 120° more
and the rest of No. 1 is wound. They are
bound by wires <i>gg</i> Fig. 13 to hold them
when rotating. The object of this rather complicated
winding is to get the three coils
equi distant from the shaft in order that
each coil will generate practically the
same current. Now as will be seen the
overlapping wires will form a nearly spherical
armature. The armature is mounted
on the shaft <i>x</i> as an axis which extends
far enough out from its bearings
to put a pulley on the end <i>H</i> and a commutator
on the other end to the three
parts of which are fastened the three
wires marked one, two, three, Fig. 13.</p>

<p class='c004'>It has been urged that the repairs
of this armature will be larger than
on any other armature. If there should
be a “burnout” it would necessitate the
taking apart of the dynamo and sending
the armature to the factory to be
rewound. But it never burns out except
through positive carelessness and it
will be found that the repairs on this
armature is less than on the armatures
of its several powerful rivals
taken separately even though they be
of simpler construction.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the Thomson-Houston armature
is rotated between the cup-shaped
fieldmagnets alternate currents are
generated in each coil in turn and
now the next point to be considered is
the</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>Commutator</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>which incites the alternate currents
so formed into one continuous current.
The commutator as before stated is
fastened on the shaft at the end one, two,
three Fig. 13. It consists of three copper
plates in the form of a cylinder each segment
<i>A´A´A´</i> covering 115° of the dotted circle
Fig. 14. They are screwed to rod <i>CCC</i> and <i>DDD</i>
which are insulated by wood and gutta-percha
plates <i>EE</i> from the iron mounting
<i>E´´</i> which is in turnescrewed to shaft by
set screws shown. The wires one, two, three,
have respectively red, white and blue
insulation and are put in binding posts
<i>DDD</i> marked one, two, three at the factory
and if not so placed may work badly.
The current enters <i>D</i> goes to <i>B´B´</i> which there
have direct contact with <i>A</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>Now in a three-part commutator the
spark occurring as the segments pass under
the brushes would very quickly destroy
the surface and interfere with the currents
in the coil. This difficulty is overcome
by blowing out the spark by an air blast
given at just the right place and time. The
manner in which the blast is delivered is
as follows: the segments of the commutator</p>

<p class='c004'>are separated by gaps of about 5° and in
front of each of the leading brushes there
projects a nozzle, Fig. 15, which discharges
an air blast alternately three times in
each revolution. The blast itself is supplied
by an ingenious piece of mechanism
known as the</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>Thomson Air Blast</i>.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It consists of an elliptical box II
whose sides have perforations II where
air can enter while inside of this rotates
a steel disk keyed to the armature
shaft and having radial slots in
which slide three wings RRR of ebonite
which as they fly around drives
air into the holes JJ leading to the
nozzles Fig. 15. The result is that, since
the spark is done away with, oil can
be supplied to the commutator in
limited quantities but still amply
sufficient to reduce the wear on the
commutator to such an extent that the
life of a segment is greatly increased.
The air blast is fastened to the dynamo
frame just behind the commutator and
can be see in Fig. 23.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>The Field-Magnets</i>,</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>as may be seen from Fig. 17, consists
of two flanged iron tubes <i>AA</i> whose end
consists of a convex segment of a sphere
accurately turned to recieve the armature.
Coils of wire <i>CC</i> which are in the outside
circuit and through which the entire
current flows are wound upon the
tubes. After the armature is placed
between them the two tubes are bolted
together by heavy wrought iron bars
<i>BB</i> and the whole carried on the frame
work <i>PN</i> shown also at <i>PN</i> Fig. 23. Now
a little magnetism only remains in the
wrought iron bars and iron frame
works when the armature first
revolves, but the current even though slight,
going through the coils makes an electromagnet
out of each tube and heavily
magnetizes the wrought iron bars and
in two or three seconds after the armature
first rotates it is entirely surrounded
by a heavy magnetic field. One of
the good points of these field magnets
is that but very little magnetism is lost
as compared with most other dynamos
and since it takes power to maintain
a heavy magnetic field, this dynamo is in
this respect very economical.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>The Thomson Regulating Gear</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Later on we will show that pushing the
brushes together or pulling them apart alter
the strength of the current, but for
the present just accept the fact and
we will show how the brushes are varied.
It is accomplished by the mechanism
shown in Fig. 18. The brushes are fixed to
the levers YY and Y<sub>2</sub>Y<sub>2</sub> united by the lever <i>l</i>.
The automatic movement is obtained by
the electromagnet <i>R</i> while a dashpot <i>J</i>
prevents too sudden motion. Suppose the
brushes to be in the position shown when
the current would get too strong owing to
lights being cut out. The electromagnet R
getting stronger would raise <i>A</i> and reduce
the current taken off until current
came to normal. If, instead, some
lamps were thrown in the current would
become weak and the electromagnet <i>R</i> would
become weak, drop A which would increase
current and this will continue till current
reaches normal.</p>

<p class='c004'>The foregoing regulating gear is used
on small dynamos and old style large
ones. On the large new style dynamo
a more delicate regulating gear is used,
the current which operates it being shown
at Fig. 19. Normally the electromagnet <i>R</i> is
short circuited by the wire <i>r</i> and only acts
when this circuit is broken. At some point
in the main circuit is a <i>wall controller</i>
or <i>controller magnet</i> shown in Fig. 19, at ST,
consisting of two electro magnet, Their yoke
supported by a spring and the yoke operating
the contact lever S. If the current becomes
too strong the controller magnet
circuit is broken and all the current of the
main circuit goes through the electromagnet
<i>R</i> which by its sudden increase of
strength quickly raises <i>A</i> and thus alters the
brushes. This only exists for a moment until
the yoke of the controller magets fall because
of their decrease of magnets strength,
when current again flows through wire
<i>r</i> because when yoke drops contact is made.
This decreases the strength of electro magnet
<i>R</i> thus dropping <i>A</i> and increasing current.
Hence <i>S</i> will again raise and break
contact and <i>R</i> again rais <i>A</i>. This is continually
repeated.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>The Brushes</i>,</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>of which there are four in use on
all machines, are made of a broad
strip of springy copper having six slits
two thirds the distance up, and thus
touching at several points. They are
held by clamps shown at Fig. 23 which
also shows the brushes. The brushes are
held to the commutator by their own
springiness and the variation of position
due to strength of current. The
brushes are set by a gauge sent with
each dynamo which shows length
from the end of brush to the holder.
The holders are set at the correct
angle by a gauge of brass of the shape
of a right angled triangle the short
side having a wide flange curved to
fit the commutator for which it is
sent, while the second side as
regards length must fit to the holder when
swung to it on the commutator as
an axis.</p>

<p class='c004'>After describing the details of
the dynamo, we will at once proceed
to find how the</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>Thomson Houston Dynamo Operates.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the diagram Fig. 19 the rotation
is as in practice against the hands
of the watch when seen from the commutator
end of shaft. The three coils
of the armature are represented by
three lines <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, united at their inner
extremities each being joined
to a segment of the commutator. There
are two positive brushes <i>P</i> and <i>F</i> and
two negative ones <i>P´</i> and <i>F´</i>. The current
delivered to <i>P</i> and <i>F</i> goes round one of the
field magnet coils, then to the outer
circuit consisting of regulating gear,
lamps, motors, etc., through the other
field magnet coil to brushes P´ and F´.
Now from Fig. 20, we observe that supposing
the loop to be rotating against
the hands of the watch in a magnetic
field the diagram represents by
arrows the direction of the electro-motive
forces induced in those loops.
The action is a maximum along the
line of the resultant magnetic field
m&nbsp;m´ and the minimum along the
line n&nbsp;n´ which is at right angles to
m&nbsp;m´. The reason that m&nbsp;m´ is not horizontal
is that the induced poles
of the armature is in advance of
the poles of the field magnet and is
constantly tending to be drawn back.
Applying Fig. 20 to Fig. 19, we see that
there will be an outward current in
<i>B</i>, an inward one in <i>C</i>, <i>A</i> generating no
current for that moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now the following pair of brushes
<i>F&nbsp;F´</i> are shifted backward three times
as far as <i>P&nbsp;P´</i> is shifted forwards. When
the current is the greatest possible
the brushes P and F and P´ and F´ are
60° apart thus leaving <i>P</i> and <i>F´</i> and <i>P´</i>
and <i>F´</i> just 120° apart and since the
segments of the commutator are each
120° in length<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c005'><sup>[3]</sup></a> there will always be
two coils in parralel with one another
and in series with the third. Taking
one sixth of a revolution and continuing
all the way round we find the
following tabulated statement showing
brushes in contact with coils, to
be true viz:—</p>

<p class='c007'>Now suppose the current to become
to strong owing to any cause, the
following brushes are made to recede.
This can but shorten the time that
the brushes are in contact with the commutator
when the coil is passing through
that position in which it is generating
the maximum amount of current and
also hasten the time when it goes
into parralel with a comparatively
idle coil. If the current is to weak
then the brushes are made to close
up thus reducing the time that the
most active coil is in parralel with
one less active and also makes the
brushes be longer in contact with the
segment when the coil is generating
its maximum amount of current. The
motion of advance and retreat of the
brushes is accomplished by the <i>Thomson
Regulating Gear</i> before described.

the steadiest and most uniform current
of any dynamo now in use. It
regulating gear is the simplest and
most natural one ever used. In its
ability to reduce the current simaltaneously

<p class='c004'>In a system the most important
thing next to the dynamo is the
lamps. The first experimenter who
produced an electric glow was Otto
von Guericke. But neither the glow nor
electric spark have been used to produce
electric light for practical purposes,
this was left to the voltaic arc on the
one hand and the incandescent lamp
on the other. Davy in 1800 mentions experiments
in which electric light
was obtained by electric sparks between
two carbon points. He showed the arc<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c005'><sup>[4]</sup></a>
light for the first time in 1810 at the
Royal Institute, which with Foucalt’s
hand regulator (1844) Deleuil lit the
Place de la Concorde, Paris. Thomas
Wright in London (1845) devised the
first apparatus which automatically
adjusted the carbons. W. C. Staite
used the electric current for the regulation
of the carbons in 1848. In 1855
Serrin constructed a lamp which would
have been used on a large scale had
it not been for the cost of generating
electricity. In 1876 Paul Jablochkoff
invented his electric candles and in
1881 there were 4000 in use, but as
their use increased their defects were
found out. Regulated lamps were
again brought into use and with
them experimenters again endeavored
to solve the problem of dividing the
electric light. In 1877 Tschikoliff
solved the problem in a very simple
manner. He reasoned that, if the current
be divided and part go through
the carbons and make the arc and
the rest go through an electromagnet
and regulate the arc and the the current
unite and when another light
is wanted the current be again divided
and reunited, the current may be divided
any number of times and the
scheme work nicely. When put in
practice it worked very nicely and
is used on most lamps at present.
Suppose there be a lamp placed in
the circuit. The current divides and
the larger half goes through the
carbons, as here there is no resistance
as the carbons touche, while
the remainder, going through a spiral
of high resistance, is small. When
the carbons burn away a little the
arc is formed and the resistance
increasing brings the regulating gear
into operation. Now the strength
of the current is the same after it
has gone through the lamp as before
because the current is going to get
through either one way or the other,
hence any number of lamps may go
on in series, depending only upon the tension
of the current.</p>

<p class='c004'>Incandescent lamps were produced
as early as 1859 but not till
1879 when Swan, Edison, Sawyer and
others were they ever in a practical
form. The first glow lamp Edison
constructed had platinum wire
to be heated. He however examined the
properties of organic substances and
finally fixed on bamboo fibre. The bamboo
is divided into fibres one millimeter
in diameter and twelve millimeters
long. These fibres are pressed
in U-shaped moulds and baked in ovens
where they are allowed to become
carbonized. The carbonized filament is
attached to platinum wires which
are fused in a glass vessel from
which the air has been exhausted. We
will speak more fully of the incandescent
lamp when describing the Thomson
Houston System’s incandescent
lamp.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Thomson Arc lamps was used
by the Thomson Houston System
since its begining till about two years
ago when they stopped manufacturing
them, only furnishing broken parts.
The arc lamps at present used is</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>The Thomson Rice Arc Lamp.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>They are manufactured in two styles
the single lamp used for stores, buildings
etc., and the double lamp used
for street service, all night work, etc.
The light is produced by the voltaic arc
between two carbons, the negative pole
or lower carbon burning away about
half as fast as the positive pole or upper
carbon. The outside view of the single
lamp is seen in Fig. 21 and of the
double lamp in Fig. 22.</p>

<p class='c004'>The regulation of the double lamp
is diagramatically shown in Fig. 24,
which is a plan of the lamp with cover
removed, showing only a plan of cylindrical
part of the lamp. The wires marked
<i>a&nbsp;b&nbsp;c&nbsp;d</i> run along the top in order to be
out of the way. In Fig. 24 the current
comes in at the binding post and is at
<i>A</i> divided into three currents <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, and <i>C</i>.
The current <i>a</i> goes to the yoke <i>I</i> of the
electromagnets <i>h</i> and <i>i</i> and when
the yoke is not held down by magnets
<i>h</i> and <i>i</i>, it goes out wire <i>a</i> to
binding post <i>B</i>. This only continues
a moment until the current <i>b</i> which
goes through the carbons and at the
start has almost no resistance offered
it, attracts the yoke <i>I</i> thus breaking
contact of curcuit <i>a</i> until the current
ceases or till both carbons burn away,
when in the latter case the resistance
of <i>b</i> becoming very high as compared
to <i>j</i> and <i>k</i> but little current goes through
<i>h</i> and <i>i</i> and <i>I</i> is raised by a weak spring
not shown, thus making contact of circuit
<i>a</i>, and since current <i>a</i> has little
resistance as compared to <i>b</i> or <i>c</i> most
of the current goes through it, thus practically
making a cut-out. The current <i>b</i>
goes round the electro-magnets <i>h</i> and <i>i</i>,
then to the “bed” through screw J, the
“bed” being a cast iron bottom of the cylinder
<i>E</i> Fig. 22. From the bed it goes down
carbon holder <i>C</i> (or <i>H</i>) through carbons
and arc to frame bed <i>A</i> Fig. 22. From
there it comes up a wire by the side
of frame <i>C</i> Fig. 22 and joins other currents
at <i>B</i>. The third current <i>a</i> goes
through electromagnets <i>j</i> and <i>k</i> and
joins other currents at <i>B</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>This is when switch F Fig. 22 and
<i>M</i> Fig. 24, is turned <i>on</i>. Now since the
dynamo will regulate all differences
in current the lamps can be turned
<i>on</i> or <i>off</i> at will by any one. This is
accomplished at the lamp by turning
<i>off</i> the switch. When the switch is turned
<i>off</i>, the current goes through <i>d</i> to
screw <i>K</i> which is then touched by metal
L (in contact with binding post B
and worked by <i>M</i>).</p>

<p class='c004'>It will be perceived that any
disorder in a lamp cannot affect other
lamps in the circuit and will right
itself or if not the lamp can immediately
be switched out of circuit.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now as to the regulating gear. The
two carbon holders are held up, <i>H</i>, by
clutch operated by springs (not shown)
till end <i>N</i> of lever <i>ON</i> is permanently
held down, and <i>C</i>, by the raising and
falling of yoke <i>D</i>. There is only <i>one</i> arc
burning at a time in a double lamp
and the so-called positive carbon <i>C</i> burns
first. When the lamps are trimmed the
switch is first turned <i>off</i> the carbons
put in and the switch turned <i>on</i>. This
will draw the upper carbons up about
a quarter of an inch.</p>

<p class='c004'>When the current is turned on the
circuit <i>aa</i> is almost instantly broken
and most of the current goes through
<i>c</i> as the distance between carbons being
a quarter of an inch the arc has
a <i>very</i> large resistance. The electromagnets
<i>j</i> an <i>k</i> attract <i>D</i> which lets loose <i>C</i>,
which falls to lower carbon, and the
resistance being almost nothing, most
of the current goes through <i>b</i>. This weakens
<i>j</i> and <i>k</i> which lets <i>D</i> up while <i>D</i>
takes <i>C</i> up with it thus establishing
the arc. The current <i>all</i> goes down <i>C</i> till
the enlarged end of <i>C</i> strikes lever <i>ON</i> thus
letting <i>H</i> drop and also putting it in electrical
contact with “bd,” which it was
not in before. After a short time the
carbons burn away, the arc becomes longer
and establishes itself and the resistance
becoming greater in passing from carbon
to carbon and a correspondingly less
current flows through <i>b</i> and a greater
one through <i>c</i>. This makes the electro-magnets
<i>j</i> and <i>k</i> strong enough to draw
<i>D</i> to them in spite of spring <i>Q</i>. When <i>D</i>
is attracted by <i>j</i> and <i>k</i>, <i>C</i> (or <i>H</i>) falls and
again the arc lengthens, always being kept
about 3/32 inch long. This is frequently and
continually repeated, the delicacy depending
upon the strengh of the spring
<i>Q</i> as compared to the electromagnets
strength.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i105.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><i>Fig. 24.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>When the carbon in carbon holder
<i>C</i> burns to a length of about two inches
in attempting to fall to maintain arc’s
length, an enlarged port at the top of
the carbon holder <i>C</i> strikes and holds
down lever <i>ON</i> pivoted at <i>O</i> (and end
<i>N</i> held up by a spring <i>P</i>) thus letting loose
a clutch by which electrical contact is
made between <i>H</i> and “bed” and letting <i>H</i>
fall till it touches lower carbon when
an arc is established and regulated
just as for <i>C</i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Thomson-Rice single lamp
has the same gear with the exception of
having only carbon holder <i>C</i>, <i>H</i>, lever <i>ON</i>,
and spring clutch and spring <i>P</i> being absent.
The single lamp will burn eight
hours and the double lamp fourteen
hours continuous running.</p>

<p class='c004'>These lamps are intended only
for a steady current and will not cut
out of circuit if the current gets too strong.
But with the Thomson Houston dynamo
the current never gets too strong and because
of this there are less power absorbing
mechanism and as anything’s
functions decrease the remaining functions
are increasedly better. As the Thomson-Rice
lamp has less functions and
power consuming machinery, it can but
be the most economical, delicately adjusted
and steadiest lamp extant. They
are made to stand a current of five amperes
above the normal current for a
short time, as, when forty lights are simultaneously
cut out of a forty-five light
circuit, the current runs up about four
amperes above the normal current for
about one half a minute.</p>

<p class='c004'>Prof. Thomson has gotten out a
divided arc lamp which supplies a
light of moderate candle power for locations
where a 2000 candle power
lamp gives more light than can be economically
utilized. It is specially suited
for factory and mill use where looms
or other tall machines are liable to cast
disadvantageous shadows. It is said
that these lights are supplied cheaper
per candle power than the standard
lamp and up to date is sucessful.</p>

<p class='c004'>He has also arranged apparatus
by which arc lamps are run in multiple
series, series or multiple arc. It is
said that divisions, redivisions and reunions
are practicable. This is also sucessful
as far as we can find out.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>The Sawyer-Man Incandescent Lamps.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As before stated Edison fixed upon
carbonized filament of bamboo. The
Sawyer-Man company however applied
for a patent on carbonized filament for
incandescent lamps on January 19<sup>th</sup> 1880,
and after five years litigation with Thos.
A. Edison they were granted a patent No.
317,676, on May first, 1885, covering their
invention. The Sawyer-Man lamp Fig. 25,
consists of a carbonized connected to
platinum wires fused in a glass tube
from which all the air possible had
been extracted. The light is produced by
the glow of the filament and heat of
gases given from filament. The life of
a lamp is from 1000 to 1500 hrs. and requires
a current of 1¼ to 1.3 amperes and
give 20 to 25 C.P. When the filament
becomes brittle and breaks the tube is
unscrewed from the key Fig. 26, and a
new one screwed in. They are run on
the arc light circuit by the use of an
individual distributor Fig. 27 which
consists of a brass case containing
a magnet in the circuit of the lamps
and a resistance coil automatically
substituted in case the lamp should
break or is turned off by key Fig. 26. The
scheme of arranging lamps so as to get the
right current is shown at Fig. 28. the
number of lamps in a group depending
on the current.</p>

<p class='c004'>Prof. Thomson has gotten out a
lamp Fig. 29 in two styles one for 6.8 amperes
current and one for 10 amperes
current. Three lamps of different candle
power, due to different potential
differences at binding post of lamp,
are use on the same current. The method
of connecting them is shown in Fig. 30.
It will be perceived that the lamps
carry the full current yet have a life
of 1000 hrs. or more. This is a great
invention indeed doing away with a
great loss of power due to high resistance
coils. It will be noticed however
that a 125 C.P. incandescent lamp uses
as much energy as a 2000 C.P. arc light,
the 65 C.P. lamp one half as much and
the 32 C.P. lamp one fourth as much.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>General Remarks</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Thomson Houston system
also furnish lightning arresters, ammeters,
hanging boards, switchboards,
hoods, insulators, lamp arms, etc, but,
though in some respects many of these
miscellaneous articles are ingenious
and novel, yet they are not distinctive
of the Thomson Houston or any
other system. Be it said however that
all these articles fill their proper places.
The company also furnish a motor to
go on their circuits but for the double
reason that of the motor not being strictly
related to electric lighting and of being
unable to obtain a description of it, it
must remain undescribed as far as this
thesis is concerned.</p>

<p class='c004'>After describing all the parts of
the system it may be interesting to know
how a plant is arranged. The last plate
is a photograph of the LaFayette Gas Company’s
Plant of the Thomson Houston System
taken at ten oclock one night. It shows
the engine, dynamos, the wall controller
on the left wall, and a view of the lamps
which had hoods put before them to
prevent the polarization of the negative.</p>

<p class='c004'>On the accompanying page will be
found a table showing experiments with
an old style dynamo given Purdue University
by the Thomson Houston Company,
which dynamo is now in the engine house
of the Mechanical Hall.</p>

<div>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>Experiments with Three Light T-H. Dynamo No. 79</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The dynamo was run by a large
pulley (about four and one half feet in
diameter) on the same shaft as the fly
wheel and beside the latter. Two lamps
were put in circuit with a Deprez-Carpentier
ammeter and a volt meter
of the same make was put in between
the brushes. First one lamp (old Thomson
style) was switched out of circuit, the dynamo
started and when speed was reached
the circuit made. The following readings
were taken when the engine made 139 &amp;
the dynamo 1122 revolutions per minute.</p>

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
